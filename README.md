### Open data for "EEG seizure analisys of rodent epilepsy models" 
#### by Helena Carvalho Schuch and Fabio Viegas Caixeta

- The folder raw_data_BaseFiles contains the raw EEG data files (*.edf) that were recorded with a pinnacle technologies EEG system (www.pinnaclet.com). Those files correspond to the basal period, before drug injection.

- The folder raw_data contains the raw eeg data files (*.edf) that were recorded with a pinnacle technologies EEG system (www.pinnaclet.com). Those files correspond to the PTZ-induced period for each animal. The files can be opened in matlab.

matlab scripts that were used to process the erp data:
1. concatenate_files_HCS_06_2019
2. RMS_amplitude_analysis_HCS_06_2019*
3. SE_detection_HCS_07_2019
4. Spectral_analysis_HCS_06_2019

** RMS_amplitude_analysis_HCS_06_2019 demands "eegfilt" MATLAB function
